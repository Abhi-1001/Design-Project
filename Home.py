Unfortunately, **every major tech company**, including **Twitter**, uses human moderators to some extent, both domestically and overseas.
    
    Hate speech is defined as **abusive or threatening speech that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion or sexual orientation.**  Usually, the difference between hate speech and offensive language comes down to subtle context or diction.
