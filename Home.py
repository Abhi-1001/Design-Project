    This project aims to **automate content moderation** to identify hate speech using **machine learning binary classification algorithms.** 
    
    Baseline models included Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The final model was a **Logistic Regression** model that used Count Vectorization for feature engineering. It produced an F1 of 0.3958 and Recall (TPR) of 0.624.

    **Human content moderation exploits people by consistently traumatizing and underpaying them.** In 2019, an [article](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa) on The Verge exposed the extensive list of horrific working conditions that employees faced at Cognizant, which was Facebookâ€™s primary moderation contractor. Unfortunately, **every major tech company**, including **Twitter**, uses human moderators to some extent, both domestically and overseas.
    
    Hate speech is defined as **abusive or threatening speech that expresses prejudice against a particular group, especially on the basis of race, religion or sexual orientation.**  Usually, the difference between hate speech and offensive language comes down to subtle context or diction.
